            
            //Q: How do we keep track of the pages that need to be done?
            //A:    We have HashMap <string, int> pagesToProcess in the chord. <FileName, count>
            //      Its counts how many pages are being processed for that particular FileName.
            //      When counts reach zero on all peers we can move to the next step

                    //Q: Where is the count increased?
                    //A:    Chord::map()


                    //Q: Where is the count decreased?
                    //A:    function onPageCompleted().
                    //Q: Where is onPageCompleted() called?
                    //A:    Chord::map()

            //Q: How do we check when all nodes have completed
            //A:    Send a message around the ring. Using a funtion similar to onChordSize()
            //      DFS::arePagesMapped()
            //      DFS::arePagesSorted()

            //Q: Is there a concurrent access problem?
            //A:    No, because each peer has its own HashMap
            //      The coordinator keeps checking with the peers until they are done.
